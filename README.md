## Overview

**SharpScenery** is an adrenaline-pumping first-person shooter game that puts your reflexes and precision to the ultimate test! Set in a beautifully crafted urban park environment, players must race against time to hit as many targets as possible and achieve the highest score. With its immersive gameplay and dynamic environment, SharpScenery challenges even the sharpest shooters to excel.

Initially intended for release on Steam, SharpScenery is now available directly on GitHub. Due to the high fees associated with obtaining a game slot on Steam, we decided to offer this game free to our community of gamers and developers right here. Whether you're a casual gamer looking for a quick thrill or a streamer wanting to showcase a fast-paced challenge, SharpScenery is yours to explore. Feel free to stream the game, share it with your community, and give feedback!

## Why GitHub?

Originally planned for a release on **Steam**, we quickly realized that the fees required to publish a game on their platform could be a barrier for a solo developer. Therefore, **SharpScenery** has found its home on GitHub, where it can be accessed, downloaded, and enjoyed by all—without any cost barriers!
